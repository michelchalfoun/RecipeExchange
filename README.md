# RecipeExchange - By Bears. Bits. Binary.
### Introduction:
Food waste is a current and major issue in the world we live in. About 35% of food produced ends up being wasted in the United States alone. At the same time, most charities and food banks around us are in constant need of food supply in order to feed people in need.
As the Bears. Bits. Binary. group, we chose to work on a project that would bridge the gap between the countless amounts of food that is discarded everyday and the places in dire need of meals.
Due to the wide range of these meals, we chose to simplify the research needed to find these food banks and charities instead of creating a system that would handle the actual donation process. This allowed us to focus on creating a web application that kept the power of deciding who and what to donate to the users themselves.
On top of prioritizing donations and minimizing food waste, we decided to implement a recipe sharing system that would allow users to create and share their recipes for others to see and, hopefully, cook for people in need. The following section will discuss the web application and go over further details.

### Project Description:
Our web application allows users to share simple and college friendly recipes while raising awareness for local food banks and charities. Users are encouraged to post unique and creative recipes to our website, while also giving other users information about cook time, ingredients, and a picture of the finished dish. 
It is accommodating of many different dietary restrictions, allowing users to tag their posts as vegan, vegetarian, and so on. The social media aspect of the website builds upon our goal of shedding light on local charitable organizations. 
The site features a “Charity of the Week” welcome page that picks a nearby charity to promote to our users. Additionally, we have a charity locator page that shows users charities near them and will take them to the charity’s website to donate. Our web application serves the important purpose of connecting communities through food during a distanced time while also promoting local charitable causes.

### Project Features:
- Donate Map: An interactive map that features the charities within a 5000 meter radius of the user’s location and that links the charities with the information already provided on Google Maps.
- Profile Management: Users are able to login to the web application and create their own personal profiles that display their recipes.
- Profile View: View other users profiles and information about them.
- Recipe Posting: Users can create, edit and post their own recipes in order to share them with other users.
- Recipe Liking: Recipes can be liked anywhere on the website. Users are able to see their own liked recipes.
- Recipe Searching: Search for a Recipe based on a keyword that searches all the details of the Recipe.
- Recipe Details View: See the details of a recipe in a recipe details page.
